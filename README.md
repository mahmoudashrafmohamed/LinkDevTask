# LinkDevTask
Simple App that display a list of news and its Details.

# Implementation
- In this project I applied Clean architecture with (MVVM Pattern + State Management) to apply Separation of concerns.
- using Rxjava3 to handle heavy operations on the background thread and to use power of reactive programmnig.
- Using manual dependency injection that will make code cleaner and more readable and handy when creating dependecies and testable easier.
- Single activity architecture its recommended from google to make app consume less resources.
- using Jetpack Navigation component to nvigate between app screens in a clean way.
- Using Retrofit to implement Api calls.
